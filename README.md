# DiskSim Simulator

DiskSim is a disk simulation software used for I/O analysis research. This module consists of a Java simulation of two of the scheduling algorithms used in DiskSim.

## Scheduling algorithms

DiskSim provides a number of scheduling algorithms, which perform accesses on an access queue in some order.

In this module, *CYCLE_CYL* is an implementation of a cyclic cyndrical access, where accesses are ordered by disk cylinders.

*SATF_OPT* is an implementation of a shortest access time first approach, which calculates the optimal access time and orders accesses optimally in order.

## Tests

The *tests* folder contains sample input and output. The input files contain the disk parameters and the accesses.
